    "So, what we can see from this, including by observation through the data file, we have multiple CSVs one per each individual stock or ETF. Which means we need to make some decisions when it comes to our analysis of the data. We will be studying the concept of index inclusion/exclusion arbitrage. This occurs when the following happens, say a company is doing incredibly succesfully and is on the verge of being added to the S&P 500 index. A firm that has their own index fund or ETF that tracks this index will have to either purchase or sell large quantities of the stocks. This means that an individual stock would have large price swings and volatility around periods where it is added or removed to the index."
