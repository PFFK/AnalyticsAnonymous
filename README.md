### Save your work!
Save your work/jupyter notebook frequently! Auto-save doesn't always work, so if your browser closes unexpectedly, your implementation work might not be saved.

### Submission
Make sure you run all cells prior to submitting your work. We will **NOT** rerun your code for grading.

Committing to this repo does not automatically submit your work to Gradescope. You need to make a `hw1_code` submission on Gradescope. You will also need to submit your written work to the `hw1_written` assignment on Gradescope.
